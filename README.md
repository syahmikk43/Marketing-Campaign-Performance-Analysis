# Marketing-Campaign-Performance-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end analysis of a Marketing Campaign Performance Dataset containing approximately 200,000 campaign records spanning two years. The dataset captures campaign-level information across multiple companies, marketing channels, customer segments, geographic locations, languages, and time periods.
The project follows a real-world analytics workflow, starting from data validation and preparation in SQL, followed by modelling, KPI creation, and storytelling through Power BI.
