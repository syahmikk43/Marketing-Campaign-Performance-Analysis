# Marketing-Campaign-Performance-Analysis
## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end analysis of a Marketing Campaign Performance Dataset containing approximately 200,000 campaign records spanning two years. The dataset captures campaign-level information across multiple companies, marketing channels, customer segments, geographic locations, languages, and time periods.

The objective of this project is to evaluate campaign effectiveness, identify optimisation opportunities, and support data-driven marketing decisions using structured SQL analysis and interactive Power BI dashboards.

The project follows a real-world analytics workflow, beginning with data validation and preparation in SQL, followed by modelling, KPI creation, and storytelling using Power BI.

## Business Problem
Marketing teams often invest heavily across multiple channels and campaign types, but struggle to answer key questions such as:
- Which channels and campaign types generate the highest ROI?
- Are acquisition costs aligned with conversion performance?
- Which customer segments respond best to marketing efforts?
- Do geography, language, or campaign duration impact performance?
- How does performance evolve over time?

This project addresses these questions by transforming raw campaign data into clear, actionable insights that can guide marketing strategy and budget allocation.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 200,000 unique marketing campaigns, with the following key attributes:

| Column Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `Company` | Fictional brands responsible for campaigns |
| `Campaign Type` | Email, Social Media, Influencer, Display, Search |
| `Channels Used` | Email, Facebook, Google Ads, Instagram, Website, YouTube |
| `Target Audience & Customer Segmen` | Demographic and behavioural groupings |
| `Geography & Language` | Major cities and multilingual campaigns |
| `Campaign Duration` | Number of days active |
| `Date` | Campaign timeline for trend analysis |

Core Performance Metrics:
-	Conversion Rate
-	Acquisition Cost
-	ROI
-	Click-Through Rate (CTR)
-	Engagement Score

## Executive Summary
This project analyses approximately 200,000 marketing campaigns over two years to evaluate marketing effectiveness across channels, campaign types, customer segments, geographies, and time.

Overall performance is consistently profitable, with an average ROI of approximately 500% and a stable conversion rate of ~8%, indicating a reliable acquisition funnel and strong baseline execution across campaigns. Acquisition costs remain tightly controlled, suggesting disciplined budget management.

While performance is strong across the board, the analysis reveals that not all channels, segments, and campaign strategies contribute equally to results. Email and Website channels demonstrate superior cost efficiency, while Influencer and Social Media campaigns drive higher conversion rates. Customer response varies meaningfully by segment, geography, language, and campaign duration.

The findings indicate that future performance gains will come from optimisation rather than increased spend, particularly through improved channel allocation, audience targeting, localisation, and campaign duration planning.
